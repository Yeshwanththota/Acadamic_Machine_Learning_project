# Acadamic_Machine_Learning_project
In 2912, spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly, transporting 50% of its 13,000 passengers to another dimension. Data from the damaged systems will be used to classify the affected individuals.

This project aims to showcase a comprehensive machine learning pipeline.

Data Collection: A diverse and representative dataset was collected from reliable sources, ensuring the availability of high-quality and relevant information for training and evaluation.

Data Preprocessing: The collected dataset underwent extensive preprocessing to ensure its cleanliness, consistency, and suitability for training. This involved handling missing values, removing outliers, and performing necessary transformations.

Feature Engineering: A range of relevant features was carefully selected and engineered from the preprocessed data, enhancing the predictive power of the machine learning models. Techniques such as feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, and creating new derived features were employed.

Model Selection: A variety of machine learning models were explored and evaluated to identify the most suitable algorithms for the given problem. Rigorous experimentation and performance analysis were conducted to make informed decisions.

Model Training: The chosen models were trained on the preprocessed dataset using appropriate training techniques, such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, to optimize their performance and generalization capabilities.

Model Evaluation & Testing: The trained models were evaluated using various performance metrics to assess their accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant measures. This step provides insights into the models' effectiveness and enables comparison among different approaches.

Documentation and Reporting: Thorough documentation has been provided for each step of the pipeline, including code explanations, data descriptions, model summaries, and evaluation results. This documentation ensures clarity, reproducibility, and ease of understanding for future users or collaborators.
